                            Situated in the 'Princess of Hill stations, Kodaikanal, the Pillar Rocks have become a lovely picnic spot. Constituting a beautiful mini gardent the place is named so as it has three vertically positioned boulders reaching up to a height of 400 feet. The aura here is full of affection and is evidence of a great love story. The white cross which once existed on these rocks represented David Gell's excellent tribute to love. The view of rocks is not something to be missed. They stand as an untouched miracle for the tounists visiting Kodaikanal
