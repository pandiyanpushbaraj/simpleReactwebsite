                            This season begins in March and lasts until May. The temperatures are high, ranging between 35°C and 40°C and so is the humidity especially in the coastal regions. Sightseeing during this time is not very convenient because of the improper temperature. The season, however, is visited to witness the festival of Chithirai held in the Madurai temple in the month of March-April. Puthandu, another important festival that marks the Tamil New year falls in mid-April and Mahamahan Festival is celebrated in March (celebrated once in 12 years). If visiting during summer, it is a good idea to visit the attractions on higher attitudes. Hill stations like kanya, Kodaikanal and Yelagiri hills are the best where the temperature is pleasant and has scenic views that tourists can witness.

                            This southern state sees monsoon two times a year - once between June to September and the retreating monsoon in November and December. The temperature is slightly less than what it is in the summer season. It ranges between 25°C and 30°C. The rains often occur in long spells and the humidity during this time is high especially in coastal regions. Some of the hilly areas see massive rainfall and venturing out during this time around is not a great idea. The Eastern seaboard of Tamil Nadu sometimes experiences cyclones during the late monsoon, making it an unsafe place to visit.

                            Winter in Tamil Nadu begins in October and lasts until February. November and December have intermittent rainfall because of the retreating monsoon, but otherwise, the temperature remains between 10°C and 15°C. The humidity is low, and it is the best climate for sightseeing and touring the cities. Most of the tourist attractions are bustling with activities during this season. The beaches call the beach lovers, and adventure seekers for bathing in the sun, swimming and water sports as the temperature remains moderate all through the day.

                    The best time to visit Tamil Nadu is during the winter season, i.e., from November to February when the temperature is relatively low, and pleasant to explore the attractions in the state. Monsoons bring torrential downpour which makes it an inappropriate time to travel through Tamil Nadu, Summer, however, is perfect for exploring the hills stations. Tourists can pick the region they wish to see according to the season because offseason visits could be extremely inconvenient for some.

Its geographical location on the beautiful coastline mostly keeps the city's weather hot and humid.

The weather is quite pleasant with the maximum temperature hovering around 30°C and the minimum around 22°C. Its proximity to the coastline also results in occasional rains, but it will not be something that will hamper travel plans to a great extent. Kapaleeshwarar temple, Government Museum, Fort St George, St. Andrews Church, Fort Museum, Nalli Silks, Kalakshetra Foundation, Vivekananda House etc. are some of the attractions that can be seen when in Chennai. The season is also famous for the array of festivals organized in the city like the Dance and Music Festival in December, Travel & Tourism Fair and Pongal in January and the Natyanjali Dance Festival held in February/ March. These events are traditional and important celebrations of Chennai and its culture and must not be missed when there.

                               Chennai is susceptible to heavy downpours and cyclones between the months of July and September. These months mark the monsoon season in the region and is considered off-season as tourism does not really thrive here. The extreme rainfalls and strong winds could prove to be a hindrance to sightseeing and, therefore, the monsoon season is not recommended to tourists. The hotel tariffs, however, drop drastically during the season, making it a decent option for budget travelers. In case one must visit Chennai, they may want to plan a trip                             </p>

                     Kanyakumari experiences moderate weather during summers with temperatures ranging from 22 degrees to 35 degrees Celsius. During this period the weather is humid; however, the climatic conditions are apt for visiting the various attractions of the place including Vivekananda Rock, Vattakottai Fort and Gandhi Museum. Apart from this, the various beach activities are open throughout summer, so tourists can indulge in outdoor visits, sea bathing and surfing. Although early summers are an ideal time to visit Kanyakumari, the month of April gets considerably hot which is why this month is not preferred for travel. However, the place gets vacant with less crowd and cheaper accommodation - a perfect time for budget travelers.

                        Chennai is susceptible to heavy downpours and cyclones between the months of July and September. These months mark the monsoon season in the region and is considered off-season as tourism does not really thrive here. The extreme rainfalls and strong winds could prove to be a hindrance to sightseeing and, therefore, the monsoon season is not recommended to tourists. The hotel tariffs, however, drop drastically during the season, making it a decent option for budget travelers. In case one must visit Chennai, they may want to plan a trip                             </p>

                       Monsoons in Kanyakumari starts in June which helps in tremendously lowering the temperature. However, the level of humidity keeps rising making it difficult to travel around. If you're a pluviophile, then the month of August is best recommended as the atmosphere is pleasant with a slight drizzle that enhances the beauty of this coast. Apart from its humidity, this is a good time to visit during monsoons. The frequent showers put a hold on sightseeing which affects the footfall in Kanyakumari in September; however, the Cape Festival takes place in October, and by this time tourists from around India visit Kanyakumari.
